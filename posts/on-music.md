A quick bit of background -- I've always been pretty into classical music. My
mom introduced me to Beethoven, and hearing Bach's Die Kunst der Fugue pretty
much sealed it for me, although it wasn't until much later that I started liking
Stravinsky, Liszt, Bartok, etc. -- but it wasn't until *very* recently (two
years ago?) that I started getting into metal, and that happened pretty much
entirely because I started playing the guitar myself and they tend to be at the
cutting edge of modern guitar technique in a lot of ways.

After a bit of reflection, I decided to try to put together a list of songs that
would provide an interesting intro to [Tech Death][tdm] for those like myself
who are (or were) less than enthusiastic about the cookie monster vocals and
image of the genre.

## [A Gentle Introduction: Obscura - Transcendental Serenade][seranade]

So we'll start off with a fully instrumental song (minus a few bits of vocoder
singing all the way at the end). Some interesting rhythmic bits, very
straightforward drumming. A nice amount of dynamics (albeit terraced, a la
Baroque music) thanks to alternating clean and heavily distorted guitar. Also a
nice introduction to death metal style riffing in a fairly approachable manner,
as well as some interesting harmonic and melodic choices throughout along with
what is the fairly traditional (for the genre) moderately legato arpeggios done
at high speed (a hallmark of the genre largely because of a technique the guitar
is itself fairly suited for called "sweep picking").

The drum figures are very prosaic for a tech death song, but if you haven't
heard anything of the style before the drumming should immediately jump out as
being very different from rock drumming (or most jazz but note on that later). A
large focus in death metal drumming is to provide a kind of wall of sound, and
as such blast beats are heavily utilized -- 8th, 16th, or even 32nd note
constant figures played at 180bpm or higher, usually evenly distributed between
the snare, cymbals/hi-hats and double bass.

Anyway, the blast beat actually originated sometime in the '50s or '60s among
jazz drummers (hard to get a solid origin pinned down but everyone agrees on
this), though it was definitely popularized in metal by [Mike Smith of
Suffocation, seen here demonstrating his technique.][mikesmith]

## [A Study in Rhythm: Fredrik Thordendal - Sol Niger Within Medley][snw]

Another completely instrumental piece, this is actually a medley of riffs from
Fredrik Thordendal (of Meshuggah)'s amazingly great album Sol Niger Within at a
Swedish drum show.

Meshuggah may not even really be death metal, but they certainly are tech. Their
music is generally focused on being as rhythmically complicated as possible, and
I'll be damned if I know what they're doing half the time, except that it
somehow still remains intensely groovy.

Fredrik Thordendal is a riff machine, and Morgan Agren, the drummer, is a
freaking master of his craft. He's not Meshuggah's usual drummer (he plays in a
Swedish prog rock band I think, and has played with Zappa if I recall) but his
drumming here and on the album is inhuman.

Another interesting thing to note is how low Fredrik has his guitar tuned.
Meshuggah are famous for their low tunings, using seven, and later, eight string
guitars. I'm guessing this is a perfect fifth below standard six string tuning,
if not more.

For some bonus Meshuggah, if you're down to ignore some vocals for a while,
listen to [New Millenium Cyanide Christ][nmcc] , one of their older songs. If
you can figure out what is going on rhythmically, major props to you, seriously.
For instance, the intro riff is five meters of 23/16 and one of 13/16. Lots of
their songs are polymetric.  You'll also get a taste of Fredrik's incredible
jazzy solos -- he's heavily inspired by Alan Holdsworth on that front I believe.
Which brings us to the next part:

# On Lead Guitar

Lead/solo guitar in death metal is overwhelmingly neo-Baroque, borrowing a lot
from '80s shred guitar, like Yngwie Malmsteen, but with a lot of diminished and
chromatic elements thrown in, although there are some notable exceptions.

## [The Unusual: Fredrik Thordendal - Zeta 1 Reticuli][z1r]

This is one of those notable exceptions. This is one of my favorite solos of all
time. Just listen to it. I can't really say much more about it except that the
really legato lack of attack and stuff is done with some sort of
breath-controlled device, the specifics of which I'm not too sure of. [Saxophone
bonus: Zeta 2 Reticuli from the same album, sax solo by Jonas Knutsson][z2r]

## [The Usual: Necrophagist - Fermented Offal Discharge][fod]

This is an example of the more typical neoclassical style often found in Tech
Death, although this particular solo is now legendary (for good reason I think).
It has many of the idioms that define the genre -- lots of sweeped arpeggios,
ostinato, pedal tones, mostly in Aeolian or harmonic minor. [Bonus: From Cartoon
Network's Adult Swim show Metalocalypse, Dethklok - Crush My Battle Opponent's
Balls][dethklok]

## [The Inspiration: Cacophony - Concerto][obscon]

As I said earlier, a lot is borrowed from '80s shred, so here's a bit from a
special edition of Obscura's album Omnivium, where they pay tribute by covering
[Cacophony's Concerto][concerto], from their album Speed Metal Symphony.

# In Closing

I think that's a good introduction to the technical side of death metal. It took
me months to get into it myself (I distinctly recall how weird it felt to
actually be enjoying the vocals), but hopefully this brief overview gives you
some of the tools needed to appreciate, if not like, what is now one of my
favorite genres of music :p

I've left out a lot of my favorite bands (Nile in particular could have gone in
this article) but in the interest of keeping it short I've cut out a lot.
