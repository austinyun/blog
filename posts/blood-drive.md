Saturday I went up to the [North Seattle Donor Center](http://www.psbc.org/programs/cntr_seattle_north.htm) for the [Bronies for Good Reboots Nurse Redheart's Roundup](http://broniesforgood.org/2012/08/nurse-red-hearts-round-up-reboot/).
That's me with the long hair, obviously.

I had a lot of fun, and finally got an opportunity to wear the [WeLoveFine Nouveau Rarity shirt](http://www.welovefine.com/1647-rarity-nouveau.html) designed by [Hezaa](http://hezaa.deviantart.com/art/Rarity-Nouveau-281710160).
I bought it all the way back at [Everfree](http://www.everfreenw.com) and hadn't even taken off the size tag until Saturday, hahaha.

Thanks to Crescent Night from the [SeaTac Bronies Meetup Group](http://www.meetup.com/Bronies-SeaTac/) for putting it together.
