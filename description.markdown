### About this blog

This is my attempt at a blog, which I'm using to document my Computer Science classes, as well as my experimentation with NodeJS. As such, the blog itself is written in [Markdown][], and the site is powered by [Wheat][], a git based blogging engine written in [node.JS][] by [Tim Caswell][].
