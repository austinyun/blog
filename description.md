### About this blog

This is my attempt at a blog, which I'm using to document my Computer Science classes, as well as my experimentation with NodeJS. As such, the blog itself is written in [Markdown][Markdown], and the site is powered by [Wheat][Wheat], a git based blogging engine written in [Node.js][Node] by [Tim Caswell][Tim Caswell].
